This repository contains a custom form handler which submits form data to HubSpot. The form handler is designed to work with Webflow forms and automatically sends the submitted data to your HubSpot CRM.

## Overview

The custom form handler (`custom-form-handler.js`) intercepts form submissions from Webflow and forwards the data to HubSpot's API endpoints. This allows you to capture leads and customer information directly in your HubSpot account without requiring users to leave your website.

## Features

- Seamless integration with Webflow forms
- Automatic data submission to HubSpot
- Customizable field mapping
- Error handling and validation
- Cross-origin request support

## Usage

Include the custom form handler script in your Webflow site to enable automatic form submission to HubSpot. The handler will process all form submissions and send the data to your configured HubSpot portal.
